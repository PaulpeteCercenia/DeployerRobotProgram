# Security Audit Report - Omega Prime Deployer

## 🛡️ Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities, particularly hardcoded secrets and missing security controls in the Omega Prime Deployer repository.

## 🔍 Vulnerabilities Identified

### Critical Issues Fixed:
1. **Hardcoded API Keys** - Found in 24+ files
   - Helius API key: `16b9324a-5b8c-47b9-9b02-6efa868958e5`
   - Impact: High - API key exposure could lead to unauthorized access

2. **Hardcoded Wallet Addresses** - Found throughout codebase
   - Source wallet: `CvQZZ23qYDWF2RUpxYJ8y9K4skmuvYEEjH7fK58jtipQ`
   - Target wallet: `4eJZVbbsiLAG6EkWvgEYEWKEpdhJPFBYMeJ6DBX98w6a`
   - Impact: Medium - Could lead to targeted attacks

3. **Private Key Placeholders** - Multiple files contained private key placeholders
   - Impact: High - Risk of accidental real key exposure

4. **Missing Security Scanning** - No automated security tools
   - Impact: Medium - Ongoing vulnerabilities could go undetected

## ✅ Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. GitHub Security Bots & Automation
- **CodeQL Analysis** - Static security analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript and Rust
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency vulnerability updates
- **Secret Scanning** - Multi-tool approach with TruffleHog, GitLeaks, Semgrep
- **Snyk Integration** - Continuous dependency vulnerability monitoring

### 2. Secrets Management
- ✅ Replaced all hardcoded API keys with environment variables
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded wallet addresses with configurable variables  
- ✅ Added comprehensive `.env.sample` template
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent secret commits
- ✅ Created secure configuration utility (`securityConfig.ts`)

### 3. Environment Security
- ✅ Added environment variable validation
- ✅ Implemented DRY_RUN mode for safe testing
- ✅ Added security warnings and configuration checks
- ✅ Created comprehensive security documentation

### 4. Development Security
- ✅ Added `.gitleaks.toml` configuration for secret detection
- ✅ Enhanced `.gitignore` with security-sensitive file patterns
- ✅ Created security fix utilities for ongoing maintenance
- ✅ Added verification scripts to ensure security compliance

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Security Infrastructure Added:
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` - Comprehensive security scanning
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` - Static analysis
- `.github/dependabot.yml` - Dependency management
- `.gitleaks.toml` - Secret detection configuration
- `SECURITY.md` - Security best practices documentation
- `src/utils/securityConfig.ts` - Secure configuration management

### Files Fixed (24 total):
- `tx-checker.js`, `check-wallet-status.js`, `mainnet-auto-deploy.js`
- `deploy-with-key.js`, `complete-omega-deployment.js`, `omega-bot-army.js`
- `execute-funding-and-minting.js`, `analyze-mint-controller.js`
- And 16 additional JavaScript files with hardcoded secrets

### Configuration Updated:
- `.env.sample` - Enhanced with comprehensive security variables
- `.gitignore` - Added security-sensitive file patterns
- `src/utils/checkEnv.ts` - Updated to use new security configuration

## 🛡️ Security Controls Implemented

### Prevention Controls:
- GitLeaks pre-commit hooks configuration
- Comprehensive .gitignore for sensitive files
- Environment variable validation
- DRY_RUN mode for safe testing

### Detection Controls:
- GitHub secret scanning
- TruffleHog secret detection
- Semgrep security analysis
- Snyk vulnerability scanning
- CodeQL static analysis

### Response Controls:
- Security documentation with incident response
- Automated security fix utilities
- Verification scripts for ongoing compliance

## 📋 Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Set up production `.env` file with real values
   - Ensure `DRY_RUN=true` for testing environments

2. **API Key Management**
   - Rotate the exposed Helius API key immediately
   - Implement proper API key rotation procedures

3. **Wallet Security**
   - Secure private keys using hardware wallets or HSM
   - Implement multi-signature for high-value operations

### Ongoing Security Maintenance:
1. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Monthly dependency updates via Dependabot
   - Quarterly security audits
   - Monitor security advisories

2. **Team Training**
   - Security awareness training for developers
   - Secure coding practices
   - Incident response procedures

## 🎯 Compliance & Standards

This implementation follows:
- ✅ OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- ✅ GitHub security best practices
- ✅ Solana development security standards
- ✅ Industry standard secret management practices

## 📞 Security Contact
